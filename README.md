# Inducing human-interpretable rules for automated document classification

Author: *Alain Milliet*

Supervisors: *RÃ©mi Lebret* and Prof. *Karl Aberer*

These are the results of a semester project done in Fall 2017 with the LSIR Lab at EPFL.

The idea of this project is to understand how a Neural network takes its decisions. Currently, we cannot interpret its results as it only gives the predictions and not how it obtains the prediction. That is one of the reason why Neural networks are not yet broadly used in the society to take important decisions.

You can read the final report [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/agpmilli/Rules_from_NN_decisions/blob/master/Rules_from_NN.pdf "Project Report").

On this repository, you can find all the scripts that were used to obtain the final results explained in the report.
